# ⚡ ARC RAIDERS: RESISTANCE OPERATOR HANDBOOK

> **⚠️ SECURITY CLEARANCE:** RAIDER LEVEL
> **STATUS:** ACTIVE COMBAT ZONE
> **OBJECTIVE:** RESIST. LOOT. SURVIVE.

---

## 🛑 TACTICAL OVERVIEW
The ARC isn't just an enemy; it's a force of nature. If you play this like COD, you die. If you play this like a solo hero, you die.

| **The Golden Rules** |
| :--- |
| **1. Noise Discipline:** Machines track sound. Unsuppressed fire attracts the swarm. |
| **2. Verticality:** The ARC struggles with complex geometry. Get to the rooftops. |
| **3. Greed Kills:** An extracted Common item is worth more than a Legendary on your corpse. |

## 🤖 ENEMY INTEL (THE ARC)

*Know your enemy to dismantle them.*

| Unit Type | Threat Level | Weak Point | Recommended Tactic |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Drones (Flyers)** | 🟡 Low | Central Eye / Rotors | Short bursts. Don't waste explosives. |
| **Walkers (Scout)** | 🟠 Med | Rear Heatsink / Legs | Flank them. One raider baits, one shoots the back. |
| **Titan Units** | 🔴 EXTREME | **Joints & Core** | **RUN** if solo. Focus fire with heavy ordnance if squaded. |

> **🔥 PRO TIP:** ARC units often drop "cores" or energy cells upon death. Shooting these while they are still near other machines creates a massive EMP blast chain reaction.

## 🔫 ARSENAL & LOADOUTS

### The "Ghost" (Solo/Stealth)
*Designed for getting in, looting high-value tech, and vanishing.*
*   **Primary:** Marksman Rifle (Suppressed).
*   **Gadget:** Smoke Grenade / Decoy.
*   **Movement:** Grapple Hook (Essential for vertical escapes).
*   **Strategy:** Never engage a full patrol. Pick off stragglers. Use decoys to misdirect ARC reinforcements while you extract.

### The "Breaker" (Squad Heavy)
*Designed to draw aggro and crack armor.*
*   **Primary:** LMG or Grenade Launcher.
*   **Gadget:** Barricade / Trophy System.
*   **Role:** You are the distraction. While you make noise, your teammates flank for the weak points.

## 🎒 LOOT PRIORITY (Economy)

Not all loot is created equal. Your backpack space is limited.

1.  **Weapon Parts / Blueprints:** 💎 *HIGHEST PRIORITY.* Needed for permanent progression.
2.  **Medical Stims:** Always keep a reserve. Drop ammo before you drop meds.
3.  **Raw Materials:** Common scrap. Only take if you have space or a specific crafting need.

## 🚁 EXTRACTION PROTOCOL

**The most dangerous phase of the raid.**

1.  **The Flare:** Once you pop the flare, the entire map knows where you are.
2.  **The "Late" Meta:** Don't stand on the extraction point. Hide 50m away with a line of sight.
3.  **The Ambush:** Watch for other players camping the zone. Let them fight the ARC first, then clean up.

> **💀 LAST RESORT:** If you are overrun and can't extract, try to stash your best loot in a "Dead Drop" (if available in current build) or hide in deep cover to wait out the timer. Better to lose the match time than your gear.
