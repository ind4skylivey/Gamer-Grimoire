## 🤖 MACHINE ANATOMY (WEAK POINTS)
*Shooting armor is a waste of ammo. Hit the glowing bits.*

| UNIT | WEAKNESS 1 (CRITICAL) | WEAKNESS 2 (DISABLE) | BEHAVIOR |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Drone (Flyer)** | 🔴 **Central Eye** (1-Shot) | Rotor Blades | Swarms. Ignore unless targeting you. |
| **Scout Walker** | 🔴 **Rear Heat Vent** | Leg Joints (Slows) | Charges. Jump over it or flank. |
| **Rocket Artillery** | 🔴 **Ammo Drum** (Explodes) | Top Radar | Static. Bombards from range. **PRIORITY TARGET.** |
| **Titan (Boss)** | 🔴 **Core (Chest)** | Shoulder Cannons | **DO NOT ENGAGE SOLO.** Requires explosives. |

> **⚡ EMP TACTIC:** Throwing a `Shock Grenade` stuns machines for 4s. This exposes their cooling vents (Crit spots) instantly.

## 🔫 WEAPON META (TTK)

*Based on DPS vs Armored targets.*

### S-TIER (God Roll)
*   **The "Viper" Marksman:** 2-Tap headshots on Walkers. Silent.
*   **Grenade Launcher (Drum):** Crowd control for drone swarms.

### A-TIER (Reliable)
*   **Standard Assault Rifle:** Jack of all trades. Good for mid-range.
*   **Pump Shotgun:** Excellent for close-quarters "Scout" busting.

### F-TIER (Trash)
*   **SMG (Base):** Too much recoil, low damage against armor. Leave it.

## 🎒 LOOT PRIORITY (ECONOMY)

**Inventory Tetris Rule:** Price per Slot > Utility.

1.  **Electronics / Chips:** 🟪 **Purple Rarity.** Always take. Used for weapon mods.
2.  **Medical Stims (Refined):** 🟦 **Blue.** Better than cash. Saves your life.
3.  **Weapon Parts:** 🟩 **Green.** Heavy but necessary for crafting.
4.  **Scrap Metal:** ⬜ **White.** Drop this if you find anything else.

## 🚁 EXTRACTION "PANIC" PROTOCOL

**Scenario:** *Squad is dead. Timer is red. 3 Walkers are chasing you.*

1.  **Smoke Out:** Throw a smoke grenade AT YOUR FEET, not at the enemy.
2.  **Verticality:** Grapple hook to the highest roof. Machines have bad pathfinding upwards.
3.  **The "Late" Flare:** Do not call extraction immediately. Hide near the zone. Wait until the timer hits **30 seconds**. Call it then.
4.  **Spin:** While extracting, spin your camera to check for player snipers. Don't stand still.

*End of transmission. Good luck, Raider.*
