## 🛠️ WORKSHOP META (LOADOUT)
*Stop wasting Ren. This is the optimal drop kit.*

| ITEM | SLOT | PRIORITY | REASON |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **MXC Pickaxe** | Tool | 🟥 CRITICAL | The only tool you need. Skips Stone/Iron/Steel tiers instantly. |
| **MXC Knife** | Weapon | 🟧 HIGH | Skinning speed = Fast Leveling. |
| **Hark & Sol "Suits"** | Armor | 🟨 MEDIUM | +5% Move Speed. Physical Resistance is irrelevant if you don't get hit. |
| **Module: Mass Dampener** | Suit Slot | 🟥 CRITICAL | **Movement Speed is King.** Running faster means higher Ren/Hour. |
| **Module: Advan. Bandage** | Suit Slot | 🟩 LOW | Prevents bleeding death if you mess up a bear fight. |

> **💎 EXOTIC FARMING TIP:** Do not bring a bow. Craft a `Longbow` on the planet immediately. It's cheap and better than low-tier workshop bows.

## 🐻 COMBAT MASTERY: "THE BEAR DANCE"

Polar Bears are tanky. You cannot tank them. You must **Dance**.

**The Pattern:**
1.  **Charge:** Run directly AT the bear with a knife/spear.
2.  **Bait:** Just before it bites, sprint **PAST** it (through its side).
3.  **Turn & Stab:** The bear has a slow turn animation. Stab it in the head while it turns.
4.  **Repeat:** Run past -> Turn -> Stab -> Run past.

> **💀 CRITICAL:** If you run *away* (backwards), the bear will catch you. You must run *past* it.
