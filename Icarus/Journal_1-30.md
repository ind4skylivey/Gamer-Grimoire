# Icarus Survival Journal: Levels 1-30

*Notes from a prospector trying not to die.*

## The Early Struggle (Levels 1-5)

**Status:** Confused and hungry.

Just dropped in. The planet looks nice but everything wants to kill me.
- **Gathering:** Spend the first hour just picking up sticks and rocks. Don't bother cutting trees until you have a stone axe.
- **Base Building:** Built a small wood shack. **MISTAKE.** A storm came and half of it blew away. Need to prioritize repair hammer. 
- **Hunting:** Rabbits are fast. Wolves are mean. Stealth (crouching) is vital for the sneak attack damage multiplier. The bow is 100x better than the spear for not getting bitten.
- **Talents:** Dumped points into the **Survival** tree for extra health and stamina. Also took "Chase 'em Down" to run faster.

**Lesson Learned:** Do not swim in the water. The fish bite.

## The Stone Age (Levels 6-10)

**Status:** Slightly less likely to die from wind.

Finally unlocked **Stone Building pieces** (Tier 2).
- **Base Building:** Replaced the wood shack with stone. Storms don't break it! Felt like a king for about 5 minutes until a bear showed up.
- **Mining:** Started finding caves. Needed Oxite for oxygen bladder. Found Sulfur (yellow rocks) - not sure what for yet, maybe explosives later?
- **Crafting:** Bone tools are a cheap upgrade from stone if you kill enough wolves.
- **Tech Tree:** Unlocked the **Textiles Bench** for better armor. Fur armor is heavy but warm.

**Lesson Learned:** Put a bedroll down immediately. Running 2km back to my corpse was not fun.

## Iron & The Pox (Levels 11-20)

**Status:** Coughing constantly.

Ventured deeper into caves for Iron Ore.
- **Mining:** Caves = Pneumonia. Need to craft specific tonics or just suffer through the debuff (stamina regen tanks).
- **Processing:** Built the **Mortar and Pestle** (vital for epoxy/steel bloom) and the **Anvil Bench**.
- **Combat:** Killing bears is still hard. The strategy is to build a small ramp or platform they can't climb and shoot them in the face. 
- **Talents:** Started putting points into **Combat - Bows**. "Pinning Shot" slows enemies, which saves my life against charging boars.
- **Food:** Cooking meat on a campfire is okay, but the **Drying Rack** makes jerky that lasts way longer in inventory.

**Lesson Learned:** Do not take the torch out in the cave if you are standing in a gas cloud. Explosion hurt.

## Steel & Guns (Levels 21-30)

**Status:** Feeling dangerous.

Finally hit Tier 3. Steel tools are a game changer.
- **Crafting:** Steel requires iron + coal to make steel bloom. The process is slow but the pickaxe durability is amazing.
- **Machining Bench:** This is where the fun begins. Crafted my first Bolt Action Rifle. 
- **Hunting:** Polar bears in the arctic biome are tanks. The rifle helps, but headshots are mandatory.
- **Base Upgrade:** Started looking at Concrete or Glass for the aesthetic, but Stone is still holding up fine.
- **Talents:** Maxed out the movement speed talents and deep into the Hunting tree for "Skinning Bench" efficiency.

**Current Goal:** Prep for the arctic expedition. Need more fur and better food buffs.
