## COMBAT SYSTEM FUNDAMENTALS

### Basic Structure
DOS2 is built on a turn-based combat system where strategy is fundamental. The game is not just about dealing damage, but about controlling the battlefield.

### The Three Types of Damage
*   **PHYSICAL DAMAGE:** Breaks Physical Armor first, then damages Vitality. Ignores Magic Armor.
*   **MAGIC DAMAGE:** Breaks Magic Armor first, then damages Vitality. Ignores Physical Armor.
*   **VITALITY DAMAGE:** Goes directly to Vitality (Assassin abilities). Very rare but powerful.

### Fundamental Truth of Combat
**YOU CANNOT CONTROL AN ENEMY UNTIL YOU HAVE BROKEN THEIR CORRESPONDING ARMOR.**
This means that a wet enemy will not be frozen until you break their Magic Armor. This is the most important mechanic in the game.

## ATTRIBUTES AND THEIR IMPORTANCE

### The Six Main Attributes
| Attribute | Affects | Bonus | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Finesse** | Physical Damage (Bows/Daggers) | +5% Damage + 1% Crit | Rangers, Rogues |
| **Intelligence** | Magic Damage | +5% Damage | Mages, Clerics |
| **Constitution** | Max Vitality | +5% Health | Everyone (especially Tanks) |
| **Memory** | Spell Slots | +1 Slot per point | As needed |

## ARMOR SYSTEM

### The Three Defense Bars
1. **PHYSICAL ARMOR (yellow)**
2. **MAGIC ARMOR (blue)**
