## 🚀 The Golden Rules (Read First)

1.  **ALWAYS Join a Casual Public Team:** You get +Intelligence for every member. Intelligence = More XP. You don't have to talk to them or play with them. Just join for the buff.
2.  **Turn on Pacifist Mode:** `Settings > Game > Pacifist Mode: ON`. Prevents you from accidentally shooting another player and initiating PvP where you will die instantly.
3.  **Scrap Junk Immediately:** Never carry junk. If you die, you drop it. Find a scrapbox or stash box ASAP.
4.  **Don't Hoard Missiles/Mini-Nukes:** Unless you are a dedicated Explosives build, throw them away. They weigh too much.

## 📈 Leveling Strategy (1-50)

Your goal is level 50 to unlock max-level gear.

### Phase 1: The Forest (Lvl 1-15)
*   Follow the **Main Quest** (Wayward/Responders). It gives essential plans (Workbenches, C.A.M.P. items).
*   **Weapon:** Hunting Rifle or Pipe Rifle. Easy ammo.
*   **Event:** "Leader of the Pack" (Tyler County Fairgrounds). Spawns 3 legendary wolves = 3 legendary items early game.

### Phase 2: The Events (Lvl 15-50)
Stop questing. Look at the map for **Public Events** (Yellow Hexagon with !).
*   **Radiation Rumble:** ☢️ **XP HOLY GRAIL.** Do not collect ore. Just tag (shoot once) every ghoul you see. Use a Tesla Rifle if possible.
*   **Eviction Notice:** Massive legendary loot and XP. Stay near the "Rad Scrubber".
*   **Moonshine Jamboree:** Great for Raider rep and Acid (from Gulpers).

> **💡 PRO TIP:** Don't kill enemies instantly in events. "Tag" them so other players get XP too. Everyone wins.

## 🧬 Builds & The META

By level 50, you need to pick a lane. Jack-of-all-trades builds **suck** in the endgame.

### A. The "Bloodied" Commando (Stealth/DPS King)
*   **Concept:** Keep health below 20% to trigger **Unyielding** armor effects (+15 to all stats) and **Nerd Rage** perk.
*   **Gear:** Unyielding Armor (Any type), Bloodied Fixer or Handmade.
*   **Key Perks:** Serendipity (Luck), Nerd Rage (Int), Commando (Per), Tank Killer (Per).
*   **Pros:** Massive XP gain, Infinite AP, Highest Damage.
*   **Cons:** You die if a cricket sneezes on you.

### B. The "Full Health" Heavy Gunner (Tank)
*   **Concept:** Walk into fire laughing. Uses Power Armor (PA).
*   **Gear:** Overeater's Power Armor (T-51b, T-65, or Hellcat), Anti-Armor or Vampire's Heavy Weapons (Gatling Plasma, .50 Cal).
*   **Key Perks:** Stabilized (Int), Heavy Gunner (Str), Bear Arms (Str), Power User (Int).
*   **Pros:** Immortal. Very ammo efficient.
*   **Cons:** Fusion Core management. No stealth.

## 🧪 Mutations: Being a Freak is Good

Mutations are semi-permanent buffs. You **MUST** have the **Starched Genes (Luck)** perk card at Rank 2 to lock them in, or Radaway will cure them.

| Mutation | Effect | Required For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Marsupial** | +Jump Height, +Carry Weight, -Int | **EVERYONE.** Essential QoL. |
| **Speed Demon** | +Reload Speed, +Move Speed | **EVERYONE.** |
| **Adrenal Reaction** | +Dmg at low HP | Bloodied Builds. |
| **Herbivore/Carnivore** | 2x benefits from veggies/meat | Pick ONE. Min-maxers love Herbivore for XP food (Cranberry Relish). |
| **Egg Head** | +Int, -End | XP Grinding. |

*How to get them:* Buy serums from player vendors (usually 300-500 caps). Don't buy from the Enclave bunker (too expensive).

## 💰 The Three Currencies

### 1. Caps (The Basics)
*   **Cap:** 40,000.
*   **How to earn:** Sell purified water to NPC vendors (1400 caps/day limit). Sell excess ammo in your personal Vending Machine.
*   **Spend on:** Player vendor plans, Fast Travel, Gold Bullion (from Smiley).

*   **Source:** Exchange bad legendary items at "Legendary Exchange Machines" at train stations.

*   **Spend at:** Regs (Vault 79), Samuel (Foundation), Mortimer (Crater).

## 🛠️ Crafting & Ammo Management

**"I have no ammo!"** - Every new player.

1.  **Daily Ops / Expeditions:** Enemies drop the ammo for the gun you are holding. Join a Daily Op, shoot 2 bullets, loot 10. Profit.
2.  **Lucky Hole Mine:** Wear Excavator Power Armor. Go here to mine **Lead Nodes**. You get 4x yield with the armor.
3.  **Super Duper Perk (Luck):** Equip this when crafting *anything*. 30% chance to double results for free.
4.  **Ammosmith (Agi) + Ammo Factory (Legendary Perk):** Stack these for massive crafting yields.

---

## 🏕️ C.A.M.P. Essentials

Don't just build a box. Build a utility station.
*   **Buff Stations:** Sleeping (XP), Playing Instrument (AP Regen), Punch Card Machine (Change Build).
*   **Resource Collectors:** Collectron Station (Finds Nuka Cola/Junk), Wood Pile, Water Purifiers.
*   **Vending Machine:** Make the icon visible on the map. Put it near the spawn point. **Don't hide your shop.**
