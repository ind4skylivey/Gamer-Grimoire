## 📅 The Daily Loop
*Do this every single in-game day to avoid falling behind.*

- [ ] **Check the Mail:** Sometimes free items or vital quest info.
- [ ] **Offer to the Goddess:** Just throw an apple or berry in the statue bowl. *Don't anger the Fae.*
- [ ] **Pet your Pet:** It seems useless, but it builds bond.
- [ ] **Gather Brass:** Check the spots in the Vale. You need this for **everything**.

> **⚠️ GAMER TIP:** Don't obsess over clearing the farm debris on Day 1. You don't have the stamina. Clear only what you need to plant.

## 💰 Min-Maxing Gold (Early Game)

Stop selling raw crops. It's a waste.

### The "Blacksmith" Hustle
The minigame is skill-based. If you get good at the rhythm, you print money.

| Item | Material Cost | Sell Price | Difficulty | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple Sickle** | 2 Ore | ~15 Gold | ⭐ | Good for practice. |
| **Iron Sword** | 3 Iron | ~45 Gold | ⭐⭐⭐ | **Best ROI** early game. |
| **Tin Bucket** | 2 Tin | ~12 Gold | ⭐⭐ | Trap item. Skip it. |

### The "Jam" Strategy
1. Grow **Blueberries** (Spring/Summer).
2. Cook them into **Jam**.
3. Profit margin is **~200% higher** than raw berries.

## 🗺️ Map Secrets & Locations

### 🌲 The Mines (Simplewood)
*Don't go here without food.*
* **Danger Level:** Moderate.
* **Loot:** Copper Ore, Tin Ore, mysterious Fae items.
* **Meta:** Bring a **Torch** even if it's day. The lighting engine is unforgiving.

### 🧙‍♂️ Fairweather's Items (The Cost)
Every year Mr. Fairweather offers items for "Life Years".
* **Review:**
    *   **Root Box:** Worth it? **YES.** Saves inventory headache.
    *   **Auto-Water:** Worth it? **MAYBE.** If you have a huge farm, yes. If you mostly explore, no.

## ⚔️ Combat: Simplewood Deep
Combat is simplistic but punishable.
* **Spacing:** Hit and run. Don't trade hits.
* **The "Dash":** Use it to cancel animations, not just to move.
* **Monster Drops:**

| Monster | Drop | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hoot (Owl)** | Feathers | Fletching arrows. |
| **Nobs (Goblins)** | Brass | **Hoard this.** |
